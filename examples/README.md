# Examples

This directory contains example projects using ChokoLait.

## Building an example

All examples can be built with typical CMake commands. For example:

`mkdir build && cd build`

`cmake .. && cmake --build .`

If ChokoEngine is not in your PATH (e.g. you are building from a cloned directory),
add the `include/` and `build/` directories to the `CE2_PATH` variable after building the library.
